# Anoma Intent Composer

**Anoma Intent Composer** is a multi-chain blockchain application designed to demonstrate intent-focused interactions across different networks.  

This project showcases how users can plan and execute various on-chain actions including:

- **Token swaps**  
- **Token transfers**  
- **Staking**  
- **Providing liquidity to pools**  
- **Minting NFTs**  

It supports **Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon**, with each chain having tailored execution flows to optimize speed and user experience.  

## Features

- Multi-chain support with Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon  
- Interactive frontend to visualize intent execution  
- Step-by-step execution plans for each blockchain operation  
- Intent types: Swap, Transfer, Stake, Provide Liquidity, Mint NFT  

## Purpose

The goal is to **improve multi-chain interoperability** and highlight **intent-based blockchain interactions** in a simple, visual, and interactive way. Users can see step-by-step execution plans dynamically on the frontend.
